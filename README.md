"And the Oscar goes to... Analysis of economic and non-economic factors affecting the probability of winning an Oscar" is a research paper that addresses the issue of factors affecting the likelihood of winning an Oscar. The first chapters of this paper are devoted to a literature review of the problem, the hypotheses of the study and the definition of the variables and the data sets. In the following parts of the paper, three econometric models are presented that can be used to estimate the phenomenon under study, these models are: Linear Probability Model, Logit Model and Probit Model. For the models that best represent the input data, interpretation and verification of research hypotheses is carried out.

The model presented in the reasearch paper won first place in the contest for the best econometric model in year 2013 at the graduate studies of the Faculty of Economic Sciences of the University of Warsaw: http://www.ekonometria.wne.uw.edu.pl/index.php?n=Main.Konkurs2013

The results of the analysis conducted in this paper indicate that a limited number of factors influence the likelihood of winning an Oscar, the most important of which are those related to other awards and nominations for a given film. These conclusions are in line with those found in the literature on the issue under study. The main factors influencing the likelihood of winning the most important statuette in the film world are: film genre, country of production, box office revenues, number of Oscar nominations, number of Golden Globes won, number of BAFTA awards won, and whether the film has a leading love theme.
